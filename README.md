In this blog, we'll explore what the Cloud Resume Challenge is, why it's worth your time, and how to get started.

What Is the Cloud Resume Challenge?

The Cloud Resume Challenge is an open-source project that was started by Forrest Brazeal, a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate at AWS. It's designed to help individuals learn and demonstrate their skills in cloud computing, infrastructure as code (IAC), web development, and more.

The core idea of the challenge is to build a complete, working web application and deploy it to the cloud. This project serves as a tangible representation of your skills, making it a powerful addition to your resume.

Why Take on the Challenge?

1. **Learn by Doing**: One of the best ways to learn is by doing. The Cloud Resume Challenge provides a hands-on experience where you'll work on real projects, improving your practical skills.

2. **Impress Employers**: Completing the challenge demonstrates your ability to work with cloud technologies, develop web applications, and automate infrastructureâ€”a compelling showcase for potential employers.

3. **Build a Portfolio**: Your project will become a part of your portfolio, giving you a distinct advantage over other candidates who rely solely on text-based resumes.

4. **Networking Opportunities**: The Cloud Resume Challenge has a growing community of participants who share their experiences and support one another. This can lead to valuable networking opportunities and connections within the tech industry.
