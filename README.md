# Cloud Resume Challenge

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics of cloud computing or an experienced developer wanting to create an impressive online presence, this challenge is for you.

## What is the Cloud Resume Challenge?

The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project that aims to:

1. **Teach Cloud Computing**: Learn the fundamentals of cloud computing by deploying a website and database in the cloud.

2. **Build a Professional Resume**: Create an interactive and informative resume website that showcases your skills, experience, and projects.

3. **Showcase Your Skills**: Demonstrate your ability to work with cloud technologies, infrastructure as code, and modern web development tools.

4. **Engage with the Tech Community**: Join a community of learners and professionals who are also participating in the challenge. Share your progress, ask questions, and get feedback.

## Getting Started

6. **Database Integration**: Add a database to your resume website to store and retrieve data. You can use services like AWS DynamoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, or Google Cloud Firestore.

7. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage your cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code tools like AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, or Terraform.

8. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments and updates to your website.

9. **Custom Domain**: Configure a custom domain for your resume website, and enable HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates.

10. **Documentation**: Document your progress, including the cloud services used, infrastructure setup, and code explanations.

11. **Share Your Resume**: Once your resume website is live, update the repository with the website URL and share your work with the community.
